# Minegrok
A fork of [Ixf1nity's ngrok-mc-impl plugin](https://github.com/Ixf1nity/ngrok-mc-impl) that improves performance a bit by completely ditching the Discord integration.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin jar from the latest Github release.
2. Navigate to the ``plugins`` folder in your server's root directory.
3. Put the plugin jar to the ``plugins`` folder.
4. Start the server and wait until it fully starts.
5. Navigate to the ``plugins`` folder and open folder ``Minegrok``
6. Open config.yml & fill the required information (auth token, region, etc.)
7. Restart the server.
8. The public IP will be logged in the console and should be ready to use.
